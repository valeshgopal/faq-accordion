        <p class="question">What does FAQ mean?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          It stands for frequently-asked questions, and it's a page on a website
          that gives quick answers to customer questions. The idea is to keep
          the answers short and direct so that people find info quickly.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="question">Where do I put FAQ on my website?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          For customers who are going straight to your site for answers, put the
          link to your FAQ or support page in a highly visible place—preferably
          in the top navigation bar.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="question">How can I promote my FAQ?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Build an FAQ section on your website with dedicated pages for each
          Q&A. By structuring your FAQ section so that each query is hyperlinked
          to a separate page, each answer becomes searchable in both your site
          and Google.

        <p class="question">How long should a FAQ page be?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          A good rule of thumb is to write short answers to each question — two
          to three paragraphs would make a good answer. If you go longer, the
          page will be too long and cluttered.
